# slideshow

This was originally written in 2008. This version (April 11, 2015) is a
rewrite of that code. I have upgraded the code to use more recent inovation.

There is an example file: photos.html.

The photos.html example uses the SlideShow.js and SlideShow.php files.
You can use SlideShow.js and SlideShow.php together to create slide
shows for any site. The files are pretty well commented. Look at the
photos.html for instructions in the <head> section. The SlideShow.js
has comments at the start and on each method.  The SlideShow.php is
also well commented.

Note 1: I have used the prototype.js framework in the javascript parts
of the examples and in SlideShow.js. The prototype.js file should be
included with this package, if not check out the prototype web site at
http://www.prototypejs.org/
 
Note 2: I have not tried any of this with IE on any version of
Windows. I don't use windows any more since I retired. I have always
hated that OS for what I think are very good reasons.

To install this demo do a 'tar xvzf SlideShow.tar.gz' in the 'Document
Root' of the web server or in a sub-directory. The tar will create a
'photosTest' directory and 'photosTest/images'. If you have already
untared this demo some place else before you read this README you can
just do a 'mv photosTest <Docuement Root>'.

NOTE 3: you may need to change the owner and permissions on the files.
